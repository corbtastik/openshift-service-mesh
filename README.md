# OpenShift Service Mesh - developer handbook

This single page reference is a developer handbook for working with OpenShift's Service Mesh operator based on Istio. It attempts to answer typical questions that arise when working with the Service Mesh by way of examples and commentary. There's a wealth of info on Istio in the wild but much of it falls short in providing the "last 10 yards" of information.
